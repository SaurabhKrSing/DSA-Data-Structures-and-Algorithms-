3. ###  What is Data Structure

    The term "data structure" comes from the field of mathematics where it was known as "structural analysis".

    A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and worked with efficiently. It is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data.

4. ### Type of Data Structure

   There are two types of data structures:

   * **Sequential Data Structures**: These store data items one after another in memory. Examples include Arrays, Linked Lists.

   * **Non-Sequential Data Structures**: These store data items with no inherent order or sequence. Examples include Trees, Graphs, and Hash Tables.
