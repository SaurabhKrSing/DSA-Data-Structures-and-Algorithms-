### What is Data
   
  Anytthing to give information is called data. It can be a number, string or even an image.

###  What is Data Structure

  The term "data structure" comes from the field of mathematics where it was known as "structural analysis".

  A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and worked with efficiently. It is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data.

### Type of Data Structure

  Data structures can be broadly classified into two main types:

  1. **Linear Data Structures**: In linear data structures, data elements are arranged in a sequential manner where each element is connected to its previous and next element. Examples include:
     - Arrays
     - Linked Lists
     - Stacks
     - Queues

  2. **Non-linear Data Structures**: In non-linear data structures, data elements are not arranged in a sequential manner. Instead, they are arranged in a hierarchical manner where each element can have multiple connections to other elements. Examples include:
     - Trees
     - Graphs
     - Hash Tables

### What are some applications of Data Structures

  1. **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**: Data structures like B-trees and hash tables are used for indexing and efficiently storing and retrieving data in databases.

  2. **Operating Systems**: Data structures such as queues, stacks, and linked lists are used for managing system resources, scheduling tasks, and maintaining process control blocks.

  3. **Compiler Design**: Data structures like symbol tables, abstract syntax trees, and intermediate representations are used in compilers for parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation.

  4. **Networking**: Data structures such as graphs are used in network routing algorithms, while hash tables are used in implementing network protocols and addressing schemes.

  5. **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**: Data structures like trees and graphs are used to represent and manipulate complex data structures in AI and ML algorithms, such as decision trees and neural networks.

  6. **Graphics and Computer Games**: Data structures like trees and graphs are used for spatial partitioning and collision detection in 2D and 3D graphics rendering and game development.

  7. **Web Development**: Data structures like arrays and linked lists are used for managing and manipulating data in web applications, while hash tables are used for caching and optimizing web server performance.

  8. **Embedded Systems**: Data structures are used in embedded systems for efficient memory management and real-time processing of sensor data.

### What is the difference between file structure and storage structure

  File structure refers to how data is organized within a file, including its format, encoding, and organization. 
  
  Storage structure refers to how data is physically stored on a storage device, such as disk blocks or memory cells. \
  
  Both are essential for efficient data storage and retrieval in computer systems.
